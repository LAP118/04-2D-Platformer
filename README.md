# 04-2D-Platformer

2D Platformer that made me want to rip my hair out made in Godot for the class C220 Game Technology at Indiana University.
Started on 3/19, Finished on 3/21 (not including possible future updates).

## Implementation

User controlled player
Player can jump
More than one enemy
Reports the player's score
Camera Follows the player
Player can save and load game


## References

## Future Development
I hate this. Possible bug fixes in the future.

## Extra Credit
Better save and load (I think?)
Different music for individual levels
Multiple levels
